# Development Instructions

This is an experiment that uses the GitHub repo as a blog.  
A GitHub repo Readme is good enough as long as it supports basic formatting, $LaTeX$, and render images.  
Hopefully this removes the need to mess with the website generators and lets me focus on writing.

## Format

- Each folder contains a blog post.
- Folder name is a shorter name of the blog post title.
- The Markdown file **must be named as README.md** to trigger rendering.


## Engineering work

- [ ] Script for automatically generating table of contents
- [ ] Script for updating post list
