# Markdown Blog

This is an experiment that uses the GitHub repo as a blog.
Each blog post is under a folder as a Readme file.  
As long as a GitHub repo Readme supports basic formatting, $\LaTex$, and render images,
I think it should work as a blog for me.  
Hopefully this removes all the need to mess with the website generators and let me focus on writing.
